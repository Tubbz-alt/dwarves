Description: Advanced DWARF utilities
 Tools that use the DWARF debugging information inserted in ELF binaries
 by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as GDB,
 and more recent ones such as systemtap.
 .
 Utilities in the dwarves suite include:
 .
  - pahole: finds alignment holes in structs and classes in languages
    such as C/C++, CPU cacheline alignment. Helps repack those structures
    to achieve more cache hits.
  - codiff: a diff like tool to compare the effects changes in source
    code generate on the resulting binaries
  - pfunct: that can be used to find all sorts of information about
    functions, inlines, etc.
